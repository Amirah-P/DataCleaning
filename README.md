<h1>Data Cleaning</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Noticing the importance of excel spreadsheets to store data as a teacher, I was unsatisfied by the manual data entry and the unclean look of my spreadsheets. I took the initiative to independently develop my skills in Excel. I taught myself how to use a range of data-cleaning techniques using the exemplar spreadsheets below. I first applied these new skills to streamline the management of my students’ computer passwords. I was able to create a more reliable system that was more efficient and reduced errors. Recognising the wider value of what I had learned, I then offered to share my knowledge with the Maths Lead. This led to supporting the formatting and cleaning of arithmetic data sets across the school, helping to improve the accuracy and usability of the school’s data.


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Excel</b> 
- <b>Microsoft Excel documentation</b>

<h2>Data Cleaning Steps:</h2>

<b>• Highlighted empty cells with “Conditional Formatting” to identify remaining blanks.</b> 
  
<b>• Removed blank rows using Filter → (Blanks) and deleted them.</b> 

<b>•  Transposed data to adjust layout.</b> 

<b>•  Removed extra spaces using the =TRIM() formula.</b> 

<b>•  Converted text to uppercase using =UPPER().</b> 

<b>•  Cleared unwanted cell formatting.</b>
